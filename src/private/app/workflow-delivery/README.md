# Workflow Delivery

This private application implements the replacement Workflow V3 core. The
[project records](../../../public/lib/three-workflow-delivery-v3/docs/README.md),
[middle-level contracts](../../../public/lib/three-workflow-delivery-v3/docs/middle-level-design.md)
and [migration plan](../../../public/lib/three-workflow-delivery-v3/docs/migration-strategy.md)
remain in their current namespace until the old Python application's last
consumer retires. This entry describes the implemented interface, not a second
architecture authority.

## Current Scope

The application selects CI checks from supplied, resolved repository facts and
collects candidate-bound check results. Its internal PNPM graph reader supplies
one input to repository analysis. Complete native fact assembly, Git event
resolution, quality YAML resolution, check execution and Release commands remain
pending. Existing workflows still use their current implementations.

New ecosystem integrations follow the HLD's
[native integration boundary](../../../public/lib/three-workflow-delivery-v3/docs/high-level-design.md#native-integrations).
PNPM integration invokes the repository-selected CLI directly. The implemented
selection/result core consumes resolved facts and does not
interpret ecosystem manifests, dependency specifiers or version inheritance.

Native integrations must supply complete ownership and reverse-consumer facts for
their declared scope, including base and candidate relations, selected quality
presets and all required variants. They must report incomplete evaluation or
unsupported relevant shapes in `errors`. An empty error array is a producer's
result, not an admission certificate or proof that a reader is implemented.
The scope label must agree across revisions; it is not a coverage inference.

### PNPM Graph Component

[`PnpmGraphReader`](Repository/PnpmGraphReader.cs) reads wanted-lock workspace
membership, native dependency closures and every project's publish-directory
metadata. Full wanted-lock trees use exact singleton project queries so PNPM's
cross-project output deduplication cannot hide another consumer's nested inputs.
It joins resolved source/output directory identities, preserving
reachability rather than promising direct manifest edges. It does not parse
manifests, lockfiles, dependency declarations or installation-path encodings.
Package names do not establish source identity. Unmatched local directories and
tarballs remain inputs with explicit consumers, including when names match a
workspace project.

Only saved production, development and optional dependency groups contribute
facts. The native `unsavedDependencies` group reflects extraneous installed state
and is ignored. PNPM 12.8.1 silently cuts off trees at dependency level 256;
the JSON depth bound accepts its complete level-255 shape and rejects the
indistinguishable level-256 boundary rather than returning partial facts.

The supported layout is a shared lockfile at the requested workspace root, with
projects and local inputs inside that root. Unrepresentable directory selectors,
ambiguous ownership, nonsingleton full responses and failed native queries stop the
read. Each process has a 30-second deadline and a 33,554,432-character limit per
output stream; cancellation or failure requests native process-tree termination
and waits up to five seconds for the owned root to exit. This is not an exit
barrier for every descendant. Cleanup failure remains a failure. Raw native
diagnostics do not enter application errors.

This component consumes the repository's accepted synchronized-lock guarantee;
it does not add lock admission. The
[native research](../../../public/lib/three-workflow-delivery-v3/docs/research/pnpm-native-planning.md#directory-coordinate-adaptation-candidate)
retains the CLI evidence limits. Layout queries, the explicit legacy-filter
override and singleton full queries have pinned source support, not new runtime
qualification. Reader tests use controlled queries and retained-output replay.
Actual PNPM reader execution,
complete ownership/shared-input expansion, quality/version facts, base/candidate
assembly and caller cutover are still pending. The root project is retained as
`.` here; this graph is not directly accepted as the CI core's project facts.

## Commands and Transfers

Build with the repository-pinned SDK. From the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet build src/private/app/workflow-delivery/WorkflowDelivery.csproj
dotnet src/private/app/workflow-delivery/bin/Debug/net10.0/WorkflowDelivery.dll ci plan request.json
dotnet src/private/app/workflow-delivery/bin/Debug/net10.0/WorkflowDelivery.dll ci result plan.json results.json
```

Commands emit one JSON value on stdout. Exit code `0` means a valid plan or
satisfied CI result; `1` means an unsatisfied result (including incompatible
result subjects) with its JSON explanation; `2` means malformed input, a planning
failure or unsupported usage, with a diagnostic on stderr. Redirect stdout
when a receiving process needs a file. In-process consumers call the same typed
operations without serializing their inputs.

The source-generated JSON contracts use camel-case property names, required
constructor fields and named check statuses. Unknown fields and missing or null
required values fail. These internal formats have no historical compatibility
promise. The concrete types are in [Contracts.cs](CI/Contracts.cs).

The collected outcome retains the plan's `comparison`, `candidate` and declared
`scope`, including when no checks are selected. Its success applies to that
subject and supplied coverage only.

| Input                 | Required content and producer responsibility                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning request      | `basis`, `candidate`, `changedPaths`, `full`; the caller resolves the event's actual comparison/tested revisions and includes both rename paths and deleted paths           |
| Each revision's facts | `revision`, `scope`, `projects`, `sharedInputs`, `unaffectedPaths`, `errors`; native readers establish completeness for this declared scope                                 |
| Project               | Stable `id`, repository-relative `directory`, build `dependencies`, distinct `qualityConsumers`, nullable `releaseUnit` and resolved `qualityPreset`, and concrete `checks` |
| Shared input          | Exact repository-relative `path` and project `consumers`, including actual version/configuration/lock inputs                                                                |
| Unaffected path       | Exact path the producer established has no consumers in this scope; no wildcard or unknown-path fallback                                                                    |
| Check                 | `key` (`target`, `check`, `variant`), actual `dimensions`, `runner`, `required`, and prerequisite keys; variant names identify resolved dimension combinations              |
| Result array          | Each entry carries the exact `candidate`, check `key` and `status`: `Passed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`, `TimedOut` or `Skipped`                                                |

Paths use Git's case-sensitive forward-slash spelling, without a leading slash,
empty components or traversal. A project directory owns its subtree, with the
nearest project owning nested paths. Shared-input consumers are added separately.
Root-level inputs and inputs outside project directories need explicit consumers;
they do not become implicit dependencies of every project. Readers must resolve
native imports, workspace references, extra inputs and quality declarations before
constructing these values; the core does not parse build-system expressions.

Selection follows the union of base/candidate reverse dependencies and quality
consumers. Projects in an affected Release Unit are included with all their
candidate checks/variants. Deleted projects contribute relationships and reasons
but cannot become runnable targets. Known unaffected changes may produce an empty
plan. Unknown paths and incomplete facts fail even in explicit full mode.

Identical check keys deduplicate only when runner, dimensions and prerequisites
agree. Required status combines the selected contracts. Required checks promote
their prerequisite closure to required; missing or cyclic prerequisites fail.
These prerequisites order checks, not individual native compilation nodes. Plans
retain quality presets and all initiating path/revision/project reasons.

The collector requires every selected required result at the candidate revision.
Missing, failed, cancelled, timed-out, skipped and conflicting required results
prevent satisfaction. Repeated identical results are harmless; unexpected subjects
or unknown statuses fail. Advisory outcomes remain visible without failing the
required result. A native cancellation that prevents collection is not a success.
The eventual workflow must preserve that native conclusion; this command cannot
observe jobs that its caller did not report.

## Validation and CI Ownership

The single test project is
[`WorkflowDelivery.Tests.csproj`](../../../../tests/private/app/workflow-delivery/WorkflowDelivery.Tests.csproj).
The existing `dirs.proj` traversal and root `ci.yml` .NET test job discover it;
`ci_scope.py` discovers the new native project roots. No second test workflow or
new job owner is introduced. Run the bounded suite with:

```powershell
dotnet test --project tests/private/app/workflow-delivery/WorkflowDelivery.Tests.csproj
```

Tests cover selection, result completeness, the JSON CLI boundary, PNPM identity
adaptation and native process failure/cancellation. Process tests use the
repository's PowerShell tool; PNPM replay tests execute no native PNPM query.
These tests do not qualify complete native fact collectors. Each
native integration still needs the migration plan's concrete coverage and caller
validation before switching a workflow.
